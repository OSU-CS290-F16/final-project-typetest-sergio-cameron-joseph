# Final Project: TypeTester
### Group: Sergio, Cameron, Joseph

### Project:
We propose our project to be a typing speed tester application. This application would generate random strings of words that the user would then type as quickly and accurately as possible. The application will then calculate the user’s words per minute (WPM) and output it to the user. Finally, the application will store the user’s data and output it on a ranked list of the fastest typists, so that the user may measure their speed/accuracy against other users.
