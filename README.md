# Final Project: TypeTester
### Group: Sergio, Cameron, Joseph

### Project:
We propose our project to be a typing speed tester application. This application would generate random strings of words that the user would then type as quickly and accurately as possible. The application will then calculate the user’s words per minute (WPM) and output it to the user. Finally, the application will store the user’s data and output it on a ranked list of the fastest typists, so that the user may measure their speed/accuracy against other users.

Instructions
================
1) Download XAMPP.
2) Navigate to your Local Disk main directory where you installed XAMPP and open the xampp folder. C:\xampp
3) Go to the bottom of the folder and open the xampp-control application.
4) Once the control panel comes up, click the start button next to MySQL and Apache to start the server.
5) Open the folder named htdocs inside the xampp folder. htdocs is the equivalent of public_html.
6) Copy and paste the whole gp folder into the htdocs folder.
7) Inside the gp folder there is a folder named sql, and inside the sql folder there is a ooplr.sql file.
8) Open the ooplr.sql file and copy all the text inside it.
9) Next, open a browser of your choice and type localhost/gp/phpmyadmin.
10) Inside phpmyadmin, on the left hand side there is a list of databases and a new button.
11) Click new and name the new database 'users' and press go.
12) The new database will appear in the list, click it.
13) At the top of the phpmyadmin page, click the SQL button and paste contents of ooplr.sql inside the SQL query and hit go.
14) This will make 4 tables that are needed to make the website store and fetch data correctly.
15) Now open your browser and type localhost/gp/index.php to start the gp website.
